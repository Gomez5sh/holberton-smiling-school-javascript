In this project, you will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

You will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

## Requirements

You have to use Bootstrap
Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes
You have to use JQuery
Your scripts.js must contain all your Javascript part
Your Javascript must be executed only when the document is loaded
